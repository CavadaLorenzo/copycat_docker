# Copycat is a python script designed to work as a supervisor of the whole system with the task of copy the file when it becomes necessary. 
# The copy became necessary when client ask for a file more than N times in the last X hours.
# Right now copycat work with only two servers. The first one is the one on which the script will focus
# checking the request that have been made to him and, in case this number will be more than N will perform the copy to the second FTP server.
